# Problem: The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
# 1 * 1 + 2 * 2 + ... + 10 * 10 = 385
#
# The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
# (1 + 2 + ... + 10) * (1 + 2 + ... + 10) = 55 * 55 = 3025
#
# Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten 
# natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.

# Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred 
# natural numbers and the square of the sum.

sumOfSquares = 0
squareOfSums = 0

for i in range(1, 101):
    sumOfSquares += i * i
    squareOfSums += i

squareOfSums *= squareOfSums

print(squareOfSums - sumOfSquares)
